Boxstarter scripts for setting up an OSVR runtime, development, or CI environment, from lovely little self-extracting installers.

## Building

You can run the build script just by running `make.cmd` - needs Boxstarter and `nuget.commandline` installed.

If you'd like to use Visual Studio, there is a solution file for use with the [PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/c9eb3ba8-0c59-4944-9a62-6eee37294597) extension - this is experimental.
